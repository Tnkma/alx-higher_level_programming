This project is to test how to handle exceptions in python programming
######################################################################

Exceptions are ways of customizing errors raised when the program is executed
We implement exception by adding the 'try:' and 'execpt' block to our code, with this non programmers will not have to be confused when an error occured on the cause of runing the program.

try:
	the expression we want and in case we sense an error
except:
	prints a user friendly message to indicate an error
else:
	what we still want our code to do.

	OBJECTIVE OF THE CONCEPT:

Why Python programming is awesome
What’s the difference between errors and exceptions
What are exceptions and how to use them
When do we need to use exceptions
How to correctly handle an exception
What’s the purpose of catching exceptions
How to raise a builtin exception
When do we need to implement a clean-up action after an exception.
